# Frontend Assessment

When assessing the results of your work, we will be paying most attention to the architecture and design of the application performance, code quality and usability.


## Notes App

Your task is to implement a note taking app. We already provide you with a basic scaffold with static data of how the note apps is going to look like. You will be required to implement these features

- Create a new note
- Edit existing note
- Delete note


Technologies allowed:

- Typescript
- React native without UI libraries. 

As a bonus you can implement the following f

- Saving to Asyncstorage and restoring them
- Saving notes to REST API, Note: you're not required to implement the API, you can mock it, but the mocks should be asynchronous.


## How to run scaffold

- Make sure you have expo setup https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/
- Run app with npx expo start
- Run in simulator

Sidenote: If you dont have a Macbook then setting up react native and expo might be a problem so you will have to implement this in plain React.
